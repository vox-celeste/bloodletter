My name is Roland. I am best known online as [bloodletter](https://archiveofourown.org/users/bloodletter), or "that weirdo who's insane about Beefleaf," or "the person who wrote the trans Nie Huaisang novel," or "the author of the big 7th Division Sugimoto AU," depending on how you got here. I like kissing stories about grief and betrayal.

This is a landing page and archive for my fanworks, meta, and miscellaneous posts that don't fit on my [other blog](https://durandal.blog/), which I use to keep track of my zines, media reviews, and critical writing, or my [newsletter](https://buttondown.email/voxceleste), which is less fandom-inclined. This site is for the silly stuff.

I watch a lot of anime and film and read a lot of books (+ some manga.) Much of it won't surface here and is more likely to be discussed on my blog, if at all. I don't always keep these pages up to date, but you can peek at what I've been watching or reading on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/vox_celeste/), [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/grief/), and [Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books-read/durandal).

My current fandom activity is limited to _Tian Guan Ci Fu_ and the Universal Century (original) _Mobile Suit Gundam_ series. Notable past fandoms include _The Untamed_ & _Mo Dao Zu Shi_, _Golden Kamuy_, and _Chihayafuru_.

This site is a work-in-progress built in [Astro](https://astro.build).
