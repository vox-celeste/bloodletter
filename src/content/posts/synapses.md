the first meaty (<3k words) fic I've written for a non-_MXTX_ fandom in a long, long time!

---

## the problem of char

- he's hard to write
- include snippet of initial attempts/the first draft
- I was reluctant to write from Haman POV because it felt self-indulgent/overly within-my-wheelhouse

## do they use condoms in the universal century?

I will excerpt my fedi posts from October 9, 2025:

> OPEN POLL (no gundam knowledge required): in fic for a sf canon set in the future but written/produced pre-AIDS crisis, should you or should you not have the characters use condoms?
> 
> i feel strongly that haman would have an IUD but "invention of massive orbital space colonies, minimal widespread adoption of the condom" feels in keeping with the setting. except where i keep getting tripped up is that gundam LOVES weird little analog tech/material culture details, in the way where describing a condom in detail feels appropriate. also the state of birth control in general is very up in the air because i imagine space colonies go hard on family planning but also HALF THE TOTAL HUMAN POPULATION JUST DIED so maybe everyone is having babies to try and repopulate the hive ???? much to consider. i feel like the STI situation on these warships has to be crazy though.
> 
> this was sparked by rotating the horrible sexual encounter in my horrible fanfic and imagining the following interaction
> 
> CHAR: *retrieves condom*
> 
> HAMAN: [trying to seem mature and confident] i have an IUD
> 
> CHAR: those only do so much
> 
> HAMAN, mentally: oh you big SLUT you're out here SUCKING AND FUCKING soldiers all over the asteroid aren't you !!!!!!!!!

## fascist femininity

- a topic of recurring interest for me; my Milner essay, my _Zero Dark Thirty_ essay, etc...
- I have two short story concepts riffing on similar things that are heavily influenced by _Zeta Gundam_, but this was the idea I couldn't disentangle from the canon; it's inherently fannish/about wanting to put my blorbo in a situation. 

_Leave Her To Heaven_ (1945). This [video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9GdAzBqDec) does a good job summarizing critical perspectives on the film, particularly regarding its cinematography and production design, use of psychoanalytic tropes, and its entanglement with midcentury anxieties about women's autonomy and mobility.

- the sunglasses
- femme fatales and psychopathic women (& reckoning with the artificiality of Haman's _ZZ_ stuff; link to that tumblr post analyzing her fashion/visual design)
- her monumental/dominating quality alongside her smallness, desperation,  jealousy
- fascists having no/minimal new culture; Axis very advanced in terms of what it can manage re: manufacturing but stilted and tacky regarding culture [include snippet from _Zeta_ novelization]

## canon review/collage

- other snippets from _Zeta_ novelization: Haman's Char-vision & the stuff about Marlene
- _New Translation_ films being Chaman-bait
- the literal 30 second appearance of Haman & Axis in _Stardust Memory_, which still managed to leave an impact...
- the stuff from my chat with Max; midcentury gender roles bumping up against futuristic 80s milsff, plus Haman being young and feeling powerless and wanting a space to be girlish but also desired and also powerful

## influences

Besides _Leave Her To Heaven_...

Sue Grand's _The Reproduction of Evil_, a work I reference all the time

other works that seeped into this one by juxtaposition (i.e. I happened to be reading them alongside the writing process): Elizabeth Smart's _By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept_ and Robert Gluck's _Margery Kempe_, desolate erotic literary novels about unrequited love as a form of religious obsession; Sarah Elaine Smith's _Marilou Is Everywhere_, for its lyrical approach to depicting teen girl insanity (literary); SPELLLING's discography, but particularly "Boys At School," for its lyrical approach to depicting teen girl insanity (musical.)
